# Talk-o-Vision
Introducing Talk-o-Vision, a browser-native slideshow. That's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks. No external dependencies.


## Running Locally

This presentation can be served from any standard web server. (For example, [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). See the included `Caddyfile` for configuration details.)

A NodeJS-based web server is included to make it easy to run locally. To run the web server:

```console
$ npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in a browser.

NOTE: This is -- intentionally -- a "Fainting Goat" web server. It is meant to halt at every error that occurs, rather than recovering gracefully. I like this feature, but others might find it annoying. That's why both Caddy and NodeJS web servers are included. 





## Adding a New Language

If you'd like to add a new translation of this presentation, you can easily copy the `en-us` canonical version into a new directory under `/slides` by typing:

```console
$ npm run addlang zh-cn
```

This will create a new directory tree that looks similar to this:

```console
slides/zh-cn/
├── css
├── js
├── slides
│   ├── slide1
|       ├── audio.mp3
|       ├── index.html
|       ├── image.png
│   ├── slide2
│   ├── slide3
```

After that, you can translate the text in `slide1/index.html`. Press `t` while viewing the slideshow to open the Transcripts window and ensure that your translated text is being used.  

If you'd like to add recorded audio, save the audio file as `slide1/audio.mp3` and reference it in `slide1/index.html`. Similarly, you can add any translated images (screenshots, websites, etc.) as `slide1/image.png` and reference them in `slide1/index.html`.

To view the slideshow while you are developing it, type `npm start` and then visit http://localhost:8000/slides/zh-cn/index-src.html. This version of `index.html` dynamically pulls in the slides on-the-fly.
<!---
Once you are done with the translation and would like to build the final version of the slideshow, type:

```console
$ npm run buildlang zh-cn
```

This merges all of the individual `index.html` slide files referenced in `index-src.html` into the main `slides/zh-cn/index.html` file, maintaining the original links to `slide1/audio.mp3`, `slide1/image.png`, etc.
