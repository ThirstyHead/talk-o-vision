           <p>Hi! My name is Scott Davis. I'm currently a Principal Engineer
             with ThoughtWorks. Before that, I ran a software consultancy out
             of Denver, Colorado called ThirstyHead. </p>

           <p>I've been writing about web development for years -- articles
             for IBM, books for O'Reilly and the Pragmatic Bookshelf, and most
             recently videos for O'Reilly as well.</p>
